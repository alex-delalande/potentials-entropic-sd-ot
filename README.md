# Potentials in entropic semi-discrete OT

3 folders:
* ```suboptimaliy```: shows the rate of convergence of suboptimality on a toy example in dimension 1
* ```potentials-behavior```: study the behavior of $\epsilon \mapsto \psi^\epsilon$ on a toy example
* ```scaling```: showcase a 1d example where using a scaling scheme to solve OT with a small regularization parameter ($\epsilon = 10^{-4}$) is more rapid than without any scaling scheme
