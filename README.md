# Nearly Tight Convergence Bounds for Semi-discrete Entropic Optimal Transport

Experiments for the preprint *Nearly Tight Convergence Bounds for Semi-discrete Entropic Optimal Transport*, Alex Delalande.

Notebooks:
* ```suboptimaliy.ipynb```: shows the rate of convergence of suboptimality on toy examples in dimension 1
* ```potentials-behavior-sourcename.ipynb```: study the behavior of the potentials w.r.t. regularization parameter on a toy example in dimension 1 with source *sourcename*
